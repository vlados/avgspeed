## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.32.8 or later)
- Dart SDK (3.8.1 or later)
- iOS development tools (Xcode) for iOS deployment
- Android Studio for Android deployment
- Chrome browser for web testing

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlados/avgspeed.git
cd avgspeed
```

2. **Configure Google Maps API Key** (required for map functionality):
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable Maps SDK for Android, iOS, and JavaScript APIs
   - Create credentials (API Key) 
   - **Set up environment variables** (choose one method):

   **Method A: Using .env file (Development)**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your API key
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

   **Method B: Using dart-define (Production)**
   ```bash
   # Run with dart-define
   flutter run --dart-define=GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   
   # Build for production
   flutter build apk --dart-define=GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

4. Run the app:
```bash
# For iOS Simulator
flutter run -d ios

# For Android
flutter run -d android

# For Web (Chrome)
flutter run -d chrome
```

## Platform Configuration

### iOS Setup
The app requires location permissions. The following permissions are already configured in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
- `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`
- `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`
- Background location updates

### Android Setup
The following permissions are configured in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`
- `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION`

## Usage

1. **Start Tracking**: Tap the "Start" button to begin GPS tracking
2. **Grant Permissions**: Allow location access when prompted
3. **Monitor Metrics**: View real-time updates of all driving metrics
4. **Stop Tracking**: Tap "Stop" to pause tracking
5. **Reset Data**: Tap "Reset" to clear all data for a new session

## Dependencies

- `geolocator: ^14.0.2` - GPS location services
- `permission_handler: ^12.0.1` - Permission management
- `flutter/material.dart` - Material Design components

## Technical Details

### Speed Calculation
- Speed is calculated from GPS position updates
- Converted from m/s to km/h for display
- Updates every 5 meters of movement (configurable)

### Distance Calculation
- Uses Haversine formula via Geolocator
- Calculates distance between consecutive GPS points
- Accumulates total distance in kilometers

### Average Speed
- Calculated from all speed readings during the session
- Filters out invalid readings (negative speeds)
- Updates in real-time as new data arrives

## Privacy & Permissions

This app requires location permissions to function. Location data is:
- Only used locally on your device
- Not transmitted to any servers
- Not stored permanently
- Only active while the app is in use

## Environment Variables & Security

The app uses environment variables to securely manage sensitive configuration:

### Available Variables
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: Google Maps API key (required)
- `APP_NAME`: Application display name
- `APP_VERSION`: Application version
- `DEBUG_MODE`: Enable debug logging (true/false)
- `ENABLE_LOGS`: Enable console logs (true/false)

### Security Benefits
- **API Keys Protected**: No hardcoded API keys in source code
- **Git Safe**: `.env` file is excluded from version control
- **Environment Specific**: Different keys for development/production
- **Easy Management**: Single place to manage all configuration

## Building for Production

### iOS
```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

### Android
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

### Web
```bash
flutter build web --release
```
